The build the docs, you'll need ``sphinx``. With the
virtualenv activated, run::

    pip install -r doc_requirements.txt

Once done, go into the desired documantation directory, and run::

    make html


We have 2 documentation projects:

* api --- API and Embedding for 3rd party apps/services developers
* devel --- Developer guide for the OpenKnesset project (TBD)
